In the repository of lives, these two branches are now merged.

Sometimes there will be conflicts, but don't panic, read the source and find a way to solve them.

The husband shall not run `git blame`.

And when the wife sends pull requests, merge them quickly.

If there's ever any problems, don't hesitate to open an issue, be open and deal with them; it is an important thing as you travel through this long trip called life together.

In terms of planning your life, it would be good to set up milestones. "Do this at this time, be this when we reach certain age." Having milestones enriches people and keeps people moving forward.

If you ever find yourselves thinking,  "Ahh.. it would be nice to be like them," when looking at other couples, please cherry-pick quickly and aggressively.
